					<h2>Computer Graphics (CG)</h2>					
					<p class="research_area_description">Computer Graphics (CG) is a broad area that can incorporate many interests. Our group has particular strengths in data-driven techniques, character animation, mobile and real-time graphics, and algorithms for visual effects. We are also interested in research on perceptual aspects of graphics and other areas. Our computer graphics researchers teach courses in the new computer graphics programme developed in conjunction with visual effects studio Weta, game developer Sidhe (PikPok), and advance technology company Unlimited Realities.</p>

					<h2>Image Processing: (IP)</h2>
					<p class="research_area_description">Image Processing: (IP) is a broad field of research that seeks to enhance particular features of an image or extract information from images. Image processing techniques are used in much of the groups' research, but our research in this area is primarily focused on the development of a variety of feature detection algorithms for use in machine vision and astronomy. In particular we are interested in the development of efficient algorithms for deployment on GPU architectures.</p>
